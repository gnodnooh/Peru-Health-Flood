# Determine the average rainfall only for the months of February and March from 
# 1980 to 2010 and excluding from the analysis the years 1982, 1983, 1997 and 
# 1998 (years of the occurrence of Ni単o phenomena)

# Determine the average of the sum of rainfall only for the months of February 
# and March from 1980 to 2010 and excluding from the analysis the years 1982, 
# 1983, 1997 and 1998 (years of the occurrence of Ni単o phenomena)

# Determine the average rainfall only for the months of February and March of the year 2017 (Coastal Ni単o)

# Determine the total sum of rainfall only for the months of February and March of the year 2017 (Coastal Ni単o)

# The previous analyzes can be done with the Pisco raster files for all of Peru (that information would serve us for future analysis) and then extract the information for each of my cluster (3584), or you can also extract it only for my cluster. (attached file of my cluster)
